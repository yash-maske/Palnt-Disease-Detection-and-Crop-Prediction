# Crop Prediction and Plant Disease Detection Models üå±

This project implements two key functionalities to support smart farming:
1. **Crop Prediction Model**: Predicts the ideal crop based on soil and weather conditions.
2. **Plant Disease Detection Model**: Detects plant diseases using image recognition and machine learning techniques.

These models aim to help farmers make informed decisions about crop cultivation and plant health, enhancing agricultural productivity and sustainability.

### üöÄ Key Features

- **üåæ Crop Prediction**:
  - Predicts the best crop to grow based on weather data, soil properties, and other agricultural factors.
  - Helps farmers optimize crop yield and reduce risks.
  
- **üå± Plant Disease Detection**:
  - Uses machine learning to classify images of plants and identify diseases.
  - Provides real-time analysis to ensure plant health and prevent the spread of diseases.
  
- **üìä Data-Driven Insights**:
  - Predictive insights for better resource allocation (e.g., water, fertilizers).
  - Disease diagnosis with immediate action recommendations.

### üìÑ Code Explanation

1. **Crop Prediction**:
   - **Input**: Weather conditions, soil pH, temperature, humidity.
   - **Output**: Predicted crop (e.g., wheat, rice, maize).
   - **Algorithm**: 
     - The model uses supervised learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, Decision Trees).
     - Trained on agricultural datasets (weather, soil conditions).
   - **File**: `crop_prediction_model.py`

2. **Plant Disease Detection**:
   - **Input**: Image of plant leaves.
   - **Output**: Predicted disease type (e.g., leaf spot, blight).
   - **Algorithm**:
     - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are used for image classification.
     - The model is trained on a dataset of plant images.
   - **File**: `disease_detection_model.py`

3. **Web API** (optional):
   - **Input**: Weather, soil, or image data sent via HTTP requests.
   - **Output**: Crop prediction or disease diagnosis in JSON format.
   - **File**: `app.py` (Flask web server)

### üìù Example Usage

#### 1. **Crop Prediction Model**:

   You can use the `crop_prediction_model.py` to predict the ideal crop to grow based on given conditions.

   Example:

   ```python
   from crop_prediction_model import predict_crop

   weather_data = {'temperature': 28, 'humidity': 70, 'rainfall': 150}
   soil_data = {'ph': 6.5, 'nitrogen': 2.5, 'phosphorous': 1.2, 'potassium': 3.0}

   crop = predict_crop(weather_data, soil_data)
   print(f"The best crop to grow is: {crop}")
   ```

#### 2. **Plant Disease Detection**:

   Use the `disease_detection_model.py` to detect diseases from plant images.

   Example:

   ```python
   from disease_detection_model import detect_disease

   image_path = 'images/plant_leaf.jpg'
   disease = detect_disease(image_path)
   print(f"The plant is infected with: {disease}")
   ```

### üìä Data Collection

1. **Crop Prediction Data**:
   - Use historical weather data and soil data from local agricultural agencies or public databases.
   - You can use APIs like **OpenWeather** for weather data.

2. **Plant Disease Detection Data**:
   - Use the **PlantVillage Dataset** for training disease detection models. 
   - The dataset consists of labeled images of plant leaves with various diseases.

### üí° Customization

You can modify the models or train them with new datasets by following these steps:

- **Crop Prediction**:
  - Add more weather and soil features.
  - Fine-tune the model using different machine learning algorithms.
  
- **Disease Detection**:
  - Retrain the CNN model using a new dataset of plant leaf images.
  - Modify the network architecture for better accuracy.
